## Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone git@gitlab.com:username/grant-application-success-prediction.git
   cd grant-application-success-prediction

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Adding the Dataset Section**

Add a section that explains where to find the dataset and how to download it:

```markdown
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Unimelb Grant Application Success Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/unimelb/data).

### Download the Dataset

1. Go to the [dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/unimelb/data).
2. Sign in with your Kaggle account.
3. Download the dataset files and place them in the `data/` directory of this project.

The dataset contains historical grant application data, including features such as applicant details, project summary, requested amount, etc.
